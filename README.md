# IntelEval

**Explanation-Driven Code Evaluation Platform**

IntelEval is a web-based evaluation platform designed to assess coding ability
across **two equally important dimensions**:  
**code quality** and **clarity of explanation**.

Instead of evaluating solutions only by correctness, IntelEval encourages users
to explain *why* their solution works. These two scores are combined into a
single unified metric called the **Intel Eval Index**, providing a more complete
measure of understanding and problem-solving ability.

## 🧠 What Makes IntelEval Different

Traditional coding platforms focus primarily on final answers.  
IntelEval goes beyond that by evaluating **how well a user understands and
communicates their approach**.

IntelEval measures:
- How correct and efficient the code is
- How clearly the reasoning and explanation are articulated
- Overall understanding through a combined **Intel Eval Index**

This approach promotes deeper learning, better communication skills,
and more meaningful assessment.

## ⚙️ How IntelEval Works

1. **Write & Explain**  
   Users solve coding problems and provide a written explanation of their
   approach and reasoning.

2. **Dual Evaluation**  
   The platform evaluates:
   - **Code Score**: correctness, efficiency, best practices, and style
   - **Explanation Score**: clarity, depth, reasoning, and understanding

3. **Intel Eval Index**  
   Both scores are combined into a unified **Intel Eval Index** that reflects
   overall coding mastery rather than just correctness.

## 📊 Evaluation Dimensions

### Code Score
Measures technical execution, including:
- Algorithm correctness
- Time and space complexity
- Code quality and best practices

### Explanation Score
Evaluates conceptual understanding, including:
- Problem comprehension
- Clarity of communication
- Logical reasoning and approach

### Intel Eval Index
A unified score that combines both dimensions to represent
complete problem-solving ability.
